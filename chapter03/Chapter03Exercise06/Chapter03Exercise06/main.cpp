//  Write a program that asks you to enter an automobile gasoling consumption figure in the
//  European style (liters per 100 kilometers) and converts to the U.S style of miles per
//  gallon. Note that in addition to using diffrent units of measurement, the U.S approach
//  (distance / fuel) is the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance). Note that
//  100 kilometers is 62.14 miles, and 1 gallon is 3.875 liters. Thus, 19 mpg is about
//  12.41/100 km, and 27 mpg is about 8.71/100 km
