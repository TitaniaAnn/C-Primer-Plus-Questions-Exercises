//  Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many gallons of
//  gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your car has gotten.
//  Or, if you prefer, the program can request distance in kilometers and petrol in liters
//  and then report the result European style, in liters per 100 kilometers.
