//  William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he needs to record the following
//  information:
//   - The name of the pizza company,which can consist of more then one word
//   - The diameter of the pizza
//   - The weight of the pizza
//  Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program that uses a structure
//  variable of that type. The program should then ask the user to enter each of the preceding items
//  of information, and then the program should display that information. Use ci (or its methods) and cout.

#include <iostream>

    // insert code here...
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
