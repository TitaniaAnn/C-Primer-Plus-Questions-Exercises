//  The CandyBar structure contains three members. The first member holds the brand of the candy bar.
//  The second member holds the weight (which may have a fractional part) of the candy bar, and the
//  third member holds the number of calories (an integer value) in the candy bar. Write a program
//  that declares such a structure and creates a CandyBar variable called snack, initializing its
//  members to "Mocha Munch", 2.3, and 350, respectively. The initialization should be part of the
//  delegation for snack. Finally, the program should display the contents of the snack variable.
