//  Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then there last name, and
//  that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string consisting of the user's last name
//  followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use string objects and methods from the string header
//  file. A sample run could look like this:
//
//  Enter your first name: Flip
//  Enter your last name: Fleming
//  Here's the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
