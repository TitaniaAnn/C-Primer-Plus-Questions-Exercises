//  You sell the book C++ for fools. Write a program that has you enter a year's worth of
//	monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not the money). The program should use a
//	loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of string objects, if
//	you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input data in an array of int.
//	Then, the program should find the sum of the array ontents and report the total sales
//	for the year.
