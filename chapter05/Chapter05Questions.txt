Chapter 5 - Review Questions
----------------------------------------
1) What's the diffrence between an entry-condition loop and an exit-condition loop?
     An entry-condition checks for the condition before entering the loop, and 
     exit-condition loop runs through the loop once and checks the condition at the end.
   Which kind is each of the C++ loops?
     entry-condition
	for loop
	while loop
     exit-condition
	do while loop

2) What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	    cout << i;
	    cout << endl;
    01234

3) What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
	int j;
	for (j = 0; j < 11; j += 3)
	   cout << j;
	cout << endl << j << endl;
    0369
    12

4) What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
	int j = 5;
	while ( ++j < 9)
	    cout << j++ << endl;
    6
    8

5) What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
	int k = 8;
	do
	    cout <<" K = " << k << endl;
	while (k++ < 5);
    k = 8

6) Write a for loop that prints the values 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 by measuring the value of a
   counting variable by a factor of two in each cycle.
	for (int a = 1; a < 65; a = a * 2)
	    cout << a << " ";

7) How do you make a loop body include more then one statement? 
	{}

8) Is the following statement valid? If not, why not? If so, what does it do?
	int x = (1,024);
    Yes - x is set to 24.
   What about the following?
	int y;
	y = 1,024;
    Yes - y is set to 1.

9) How does cin>>ch differ from cin.get(ch) and ch=cin.get() in how it views input? 
	cin >> ch; reads the next char but not a space.
	cin.get(ch); reads the next char even if it is a space.
